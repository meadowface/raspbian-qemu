The binary tests/test.img.gz includes a binary copy of busybox
(https://www.busybox.net/) fetched from the Raspbian Archive at
https://archive.raspbian.org/.  It is released under the GPL v2 as outlined
at https://www.busybox.net/license.html.  The source for that binary is also
available from the Raspbian Archive at https://archive.raspbian.org/.  The
specific version fetched is included in the tests/make-test-image script in
this repository.

Busybox is not included as part of this software, but rather as a tool used
in the test suite.
